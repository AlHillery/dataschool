# Heading Size One

A couple of years ago, I put on my shoes, grabbed my purse, and asked my dog, Luna, if she needed anything from the bodega. It was then that I realized just how deep into the madness of pet anthropomorphism I had sunk. My excuse, of course, is the same as every other nut job’s. I swear that Luna, a fluffy, mischievous, ninety-pound Border collie–Great Pyrenees mix, is basically a human. She’s as big as one, anyway, and as expressive. Friends come over for parties, gaze into her skeptical hazel eyes, and inform me that Luna resembles a person wearing a dog suit. Because I work from home, I’ve spent much more time with her than I have with my actual human partner, and every day I observe her mood shifting like the light in our apartment: she’s sleepy; she’s hyper; she’s on edge; she’s happy; she wants to be left alone. Like most dog-owners, I have developed an embarrassing voice that I use to ventriloquize her thoughts and feelings (as I imagine them, anyway), and, if Luna were docile enough to dress up in anything more complicated than a bandanna, I would probably style a full outfit for her every day.

## Lists

People love lists because they provide very clear breaks in the visual hierarchy and are easy to scan. Lists formatted with GRT are beautifully spaced and will keep your visitors engaged and moving down the page.

*   Unordered list item 1
*   Unordered list item 2
*   Unordered list item 3
    *   Nested list item 1
    *   Nested list item 2
*   Unordered list item 4

But what about ordered lists? We’ve got those covered, too:<sup id="f2r">[2](#f2)</sup>

1.  Ordered list item 1
2.  Ordered list item 2
3.  Ordered list item 3
4.  Ordered list item 4

## Blockquotes

When including a quote or citation in your content, be sure to use `<blockquote>` styles for the most savvy presentation. Consider this profound statement about typography:

> The mathematical proportions of typography are vitally important to how readers perceive both your site and your content.

Heavy!

<!-- ## Alerts, Notes, and Content Boxes

Sometimes you need to draw special attention to a chunk of text, and GRT makes it easy to do this with 3 handy “box” formats—alerts, notes, and content boxes.

### Alerts

Got some serious information to convey to visitors? You need an alert.

<div class="alert">

**Attention!** Alerts are the best way to convey important messages to your readers.

They can be used to wrap multiple paragraphs or any other HTML elements you need to get your point across.

</div>


Sometimes you only need one paragraph for your alert, and that’s fine, too.

### Notes

Alerts are strong, but there are plenty of situations where they’re a little *too* strong. And that’s where you can use notes for a high impact without all the fuss:

<div class="note">


Notes offer a more subtle way to draw attention to your content.

And like alerts, notes can encompass other HTML elements or they can stand on their own, as seen below.

</div>


One thing is certain—your notes won’t go unnoticed!

### Content Boxes

Sometimes notes are too subtle and alerts just aren’t appropriate. Enter content boxes, which scream “Hey, over here!”

<div class="box">


Content boxes are perfect for tweetables, email signup forms, or anything else where visitor attention is at a premium.

Use ‘em like a boss, and pretty soon, you’ll *be* the boss.

</div> -->


## Code Formatting

You’ve already seen <code>inline code styling</code> via the `<code>` tag a few times on this page. GRT also provides tidy preformatted code styling via the `<pre>` tag, as seen in this snippet of fictitious <abbr title="recursive acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> code:

<pre> functionBaby(); </pre>

But we’re not done with code-related stuff just yet! GRT also includes keyboard element styles. Wait, what?

### Keyboard Formatting

Occasionally, you may need to give your readers directions that include keyboard references. The `<kbd>` element is perfect for this application:

#### Save

*   Mac: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>
*   Win: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>


#### Find

*   Mac: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd>
*   Win: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd>


#### Replace

*   Mac: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>
*   Win: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>
