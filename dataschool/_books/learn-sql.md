Welcome to our PostgreSQL interactive SQL Tutorial! We’ve designed this specifically for tech-savvy folks to learn enough SQL to be able to do their own analysis and data fetching.

We’ve added a big innovation to our tutorial that makes it quite different: Because we believe the best way to learn SQL is by playing around, we’ve created an interactive **SQLBox** for you to follow along and play with writing queries from the very start. The SQLBox takes your input and runs it against a live PostgreSQL database that we’re hosting.

The SQLBox is embedded right in to the lessons themselves. Some of them have a checkbox to their left. These are ones that have a correct answer to them. See if you can get all of them correct!
