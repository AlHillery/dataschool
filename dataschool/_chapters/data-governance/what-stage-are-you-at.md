## [Stage 1 - Source](https://dataschool.com/data-governance/source-data-tools/)

### This stage is right for you if

* You have a small team with only a few people using data
* You have minimal data needs at the moment
* You only have data in a few small sources
* The only people who need to make new visuals are fairly technical

### You’ve outgrown this stage if

* You have data you need access to in multiple places/applications
* You need unique or combined charts/dashboards for cloud application sources like Salesforce
* More than just a few people need access to this data
* You’re struggling with performance issues
* You have a set of data that’s getting too big for a transactional database
* Non-technical users need to create their own charts

## [Stage 2 - Lake](https://dataschool.com/data-governance/why-build-a-data-lake/)

### This stage is right for you if:

* You need unique or combined charts/dashboards for cloud application sources like Salesforce.
* Your charts and dashboards will be created by a core set of people who will all be able to learn the ins and outs of the structure of the messy data.
* You’re intimidated by data modeling (but just don’t be - that’s why we have this book).
* You cannot spare the time for even light data modeling and are okay, for now, with the technical debt you’re taking on.
* You have large sets of data and need more performant queries.

### You’ve outgrown this stage if:

* More than a few people are going to be working with this dataset.
* You want a clean source of truth of your company.
* You don’t like fighting with integrity issues.
* You need to separate the structure of the data from the always changing transactional sources.
* You Don’t like Repeating Yourself (DRY)

## [Stage 3 - Warehouse](https://dataschool.com/data-governance/why-build-a-data-warehouse/)

### This stage is right for you if:

* More than a few people are going to be working with this dataset
* You want a clean source of truth of your company
* You don’t like fighting integrity issues
* You need to separate the structure of the data from the always changing transactional sources.
* You Don’t like Repeating Yourself (DRY)

### You’ve outgrown this stage if:

* You want to get democratized - and enable others in your company to explore and understand data themselves
* You’re prepared to teach and enable business users in your company - hopefully using the many resources of the Data School
* You have projects that require different formats of the source of truth for easier use
* Having truly informed employees is important to your company’s competitive success

## [Stage 4 - Mart](https://dataschool.com/data-governance/why-build-data-marts/)

### This stage is right for you if:

* You want to get democratized and enable others in your company to explore and understand data themselves
* You’re prepared to teach and enable business users in your company - hopefully using the many resources of [The Data School](https://dataschool.com/)
* You have projects that require different formats of the source of truth for easier use
* Having truly informed employees is important to your company’s competitive success

### You’ve outgrown this stage if:

* You can’t really! You can make any number of marts, and even put leveling in your marts if you’d like. Implementing this stage will result in a complete, well architected and governed stack that will continually evolve and support your informed competitive company.
