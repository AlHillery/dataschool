## [Stage 3 - Warehouse](https://dataschool.com/data-governance/why-build-a-data-warehouse/)

### This stage is right for you if:

* More than a few people are going to be working with this dataset
* You want a clean source of truth of your company
* You don’t like fighting integrity issues
* You need to separate the structure of the data from the always changing transactional sources.
* You Don’t like Repeating Yourself (DRY)

### You’ve outgrown this stage if:

* You want to get democratized - and enable others in your company to explore and understand data themselves
* You’re prepared to teach and enable business users in your company - hopefully using the many resources of the Data School
* You have projects that require different formats of the source of truth for easier use
* Having truly informed employees is important to your company’s competitive success
