Data School wants a comprehensive Postgres SQL Cheat Sheet. There are many out there, my favorite is:

[https://github.com/enochtangg/quick-SQL-cheatsheet](https://github.com/enochtangg/quick-SQL-cheatsheet "https://github.com/enochtangg/quick-SQL-cheatsheet")

We want to use this format but use SQLbox to have live examples and provide visuals to help people better understand what these queries are doing. We also want to include a section on working with dates.
