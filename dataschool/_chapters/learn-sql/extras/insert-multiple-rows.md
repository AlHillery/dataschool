Data School wants a comprehensive post with visuals to help people understand how to insert multiple rows in a single query. Please use stack overflow to understand the many variations but map the answers to Postgres: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/452859/inserting-multiple-rows-in-a-single-sql-query](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/452859/inserting-multiple-rows-in-a-single-sql-query "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/452859/inserting-multiple-rows-in-a-single-sql-query")

The structure of the post should be

* **Answer the question simply** (provide sql query when appropriate)
* **Define example scenario** we will be using (use a familiar dataset: facebook friends, Amazon store, Uber riders, etc)
  * Provide a small table
* **Use images to show** what is happening
  * link to other Data School pages/images where appropriate (joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions, case when)
* **Demonstrate** in detail with SQL
* **Recap** why this was important to answer the question
