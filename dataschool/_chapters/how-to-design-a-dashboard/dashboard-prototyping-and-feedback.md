## Review

First gather your documents stating the goal, decisions, and metrics in one place. Do a quick review to make sure you understand all the requirements for this dashboard.

Now itâ€™s time to put pen to paper. In a typical design process the prototyping stage involves heavy divergent thinking to explore a wide range of solutions. In a dashboard design process the output is pretty heavily constrained to a few chart types. This means that you can start sketching pretty accurate designs right away.

## Sketch

Start with individual metrics and draw them as visualizations. Remember to try drawing them aggregated and grouped in different ways. Keep asking yourself:

* What decisions does the audience need to make?
* What does the audience need to know in order to make those decisions?

It is common to have new ideas for metrics while sketching. Go ahead and sketch them and then evaluate whether they serve to inform the decisions that need to be made from this dashboard. If you do end up keeping them, go back and fill out the Metric Spreadsheet with the details so that you can build them easier later on.

Then try drawing multiple visualizations together. As you sketch out different combinations of visualizations for the dashboard try to limit the number you use in each attempt to as few as possible. Start by asking if you only had 1 chart which would it be. If you had 2,3,4 etc: go through the same process. This will help you determine which should be prioritized visually.

## Feedback

Ask the Point Person for feedback on the sketches. Would your sketched dashboard better inform their decisions. Ask other members of the final audience for feedback at this stage. Changing a sketch is relatively easy compared with querying for new data.

Sometimes people are hesitant to provide feedback. There are a few easy tricks to getting them to five actionable critiques. Ask the following questions for each visualization:

* Restate what are the decisions that you will be making based on this dashboard?
* Do they need to know this information to make their decision?
* What else do I want to know about this metric?
* Is the conclusion I can draw from the visualization obvious?
* Would this metric change my decision if it was much higher or much lower than is normal?

Ask the following questions for the whole dashboard:

* Does this dashboard support the decisions and goals of this project?
* Which visualization grabs your eye first? Should it?
* Should any of these visualizations be grouped together?
* Is anything missing from the dashboard?

## Iteration

Be open to feedback. The goal is to create a useful dashboard for the audience, not to convince people your design is great. You will likely need to do more than one round of prototyping, feedback, and iteration to find the right mix of visualizations. After you feel confident the dashboard contains the most highly relevant information to help support the decisions you are ready to bring the various charts to life.
